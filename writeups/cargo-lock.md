# `Cargo.lock`

This file is automatically generated, it usually contains checksums of the
dependencies of the project, but since our project doesn't have any it only
shows our name and version that we've seen in [`Cargo.toml`](cargo-toml.md).

```toml
# This file is automatically @generated by Cargo.
# It is not intended for manual editing.
version = 3

[[package]]
name = "asdf"
version = "0.1.0"
```
